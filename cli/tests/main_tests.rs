//! Repository: https://github.com/christimahu/devrs
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This integration test file focuses on verifying the top-level behavior
//! of the `devrs` command-line interface, such as handling standard flags
//! like `--version` and `--help`, and the `help` subcommand itself.
//!

// Declare and use the common module for helpers like `devrs_cmd()`
